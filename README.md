## Usage

### Run the application:

```
npm start
```

This will:

1. Start monitoring Pitchfork's Best New Music page
2. Run on the schedule defined in your `.env` file
3. Send notifications to your Telegram bot when new music is found

### Run the browser test:

```
npm test
```

This will:

1. Launch a headless browser
2. Visit Pitchfork's Best New Music page
3. Extract data and save it to the `test-output` directory
4. Generate a screenshot and HTML dump for debugging purposes

## Deploying as a Service

### Using PM2:

1. Install PM2 globally:

   ```
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. Start the application:

   ```
   pm2 start src/index.js --name pitchfork-tracker
   ```

3. Configure PM2 to start on system boot:
   ```
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

### Using Docker (Raspberry Pi compatible):

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your Raspberry Pi:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pitchfork-parser
   ```

3. Create and configure the `.env` file as described above.

4. Build and start the Docker container:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. To view logs:

   ```
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

6. To stop the service:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

The Docker setup is optimized for ARM processors like the one in Raspberry Pi 5.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're not receiving Telegram messages, verify your bot token and chat ID
- If music searches aren't working, check your Spotify API credentials
- For parser issues, run the browser test to see if the website structure has changed
